Placeholder for an explanation why we're doing it.

TODO

1. Introduce `styleguide check` - it will check if project has proper configuration
2. pre-commit
3. SCSS checks
4. JS checks (js lint)
5. Optional information in CLI how to setup everything locally
6. Automate local setup for dependencies (e.g. pre-commit)
7. README
8. Add filtering options for setup (e.g. `styleguide install --exclude jshint jslint`)
9. Think about reoganising structure for configuration files
