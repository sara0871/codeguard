Ruby coding style @ codequest
---

We are using [RuboCop][rubocop] to enforce Ruby style in our projects, with settings very similar to the default (GitHub) ones. Our specific overrides with explanations can be found in the `.rubocop.yml` file. Once this file is copied to the root of the project a [RubyMine][rubymine-plugin] or [SublimeText][sublime-plugin] plugin will pick it up and enforce relevant coding style.
